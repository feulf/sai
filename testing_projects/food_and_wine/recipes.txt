Spaghetti alla carbonara

Spaghetti alla carbonara is a Roman pasta dish from the Lazio region of Italy. It is made with egg, hard cheese, guanciale, and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century. The dish is popular in Rome and in the surrounding area of Lazio, where it is considered a traditional dish. It is also popular in the United States, where it is often served in Italian restaurants. The dish is sometimes served with a sprinkling of parsley.
Boil the spaghetti in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the guanciale and cook until the fat is rendered and the meat is crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the spaghetti and toss to coat. Add the egg and cheese and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
